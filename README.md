# TaskFlow-App
I created the TaskFlow application, a task management tool focused on streamlining workflow and productivity. Utilizing JavaScript and responsive design principles, I implemented core features such as task creation, editing, and status tracking. This project deepened my experience in building interactive and user-centric web applications.
